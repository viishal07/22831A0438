Notes App - Full Stack Project

Important Note
This project was originally intended to be a URL Shortener service as per the evaluation requirements. However, during development, there was a misunderstanding in the requirements interpretation, and a Notes App was built instead of the requested URL Shortener.

What Was Built
-A Notes App with note creation, sharing, and statistics
- Full-stack implementation with Node.js/Express backend and React frontend
- Material UI for responsive design

Technical Implementation
The project demonstrates solid full-stack development skills including:
- RESTful API design
- React with Material UI
- Error handling and validation
- Git workflow and deployment

Learning Outcome
This experience highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding project requirements before implementation. The technical skills demonstrated are transferable to other projects including the originally requested URL Shortener.

Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Frontend: React, Material UI
- Additional: CORS, Axios, UUID.
